# Install oh-my-zsh

https://ohmyz.sh

# Install additional plugins

Below two plugins are present in `.zshrc` plugins list, but not part of `.oh-my-zsh/plugins` directory.
Fix the issue by using below commands

```
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```
